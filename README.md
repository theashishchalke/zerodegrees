Repository for Zero Degrees book series

I’ve been associated with CyberSecurity [or infosec if you prefer] for nearly a decade now, mostly in a role
that some people might hate (Sales Engineer). I really love discovering and working with open-source tools.
In the field, organizations don’t implement solutions (read:tools) citing budget concerns. I broadly
categorize tools into two categories – The Need to have – must have solutions that you need to spend
money on such as Firewalls, endpoint security; and the – Good to have – solutions that you implement if
you have the budget. Ideally, if you are going to buy a solution that you are only going to utilize 30% of it’s
capabilities, that’s a Good to Have solution, unless those are supported by business goals. Secondly, tools
play an important part in helping your team. Your team may have great analysts and some good analysts.
Tools help to level the playing field.

I initially thought of writing a book that documents different open source tools that organizations can
implement from their Good to Have list, but then thought of how could this make more impact? Rather
than a 500 page book, how about I create quick books focusing on one aspect? Rather than charging for a
book, how about I distribute it for free so that anyone can pick it up and implement!

I intend to publish at least 4 of these mini-books, looking at different aspects in 2020. The one you are
reading aims to add to your Security Awareness program by harnessing active phishing simulations and
converting the users into another layer of your Cyber Defense strategy.

If you find this useful, do share with others and help make the internet safer. After all Security = Safety.
